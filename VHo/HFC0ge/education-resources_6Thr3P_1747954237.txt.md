# Hi!

- This is the first time I'm doing something like this, and I don't have much experience with contribution - just the basic pull requests, issues.

- If you're willing to contribute to the list, please keep the format as below:

[ Name of company under which it is offered ] ( the main link )

- Some description about what it is - or just provide the main link, that's fine, like in the Udemy courses.
- Add some tags to easily make people understand what it's related to - it's something I should do too, as well.
